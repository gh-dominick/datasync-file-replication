# Data Replication with AWS DataSync

### DataSync Components -- Task

A task joins the two locations with the agent and coordinates the data transfer based on the configured options. Once available, you can initiate the sync process manually or have it follow a schedule.

- The task console also includes a history panel that logs statuses from each sync run.
